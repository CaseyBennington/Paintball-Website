#To get this up and running please follow the directions listed below.

1. Extract this file into c:\xampplite\htdocs, or import into NetBeans to
    same directory.
2. Be sure xampplite is running.
3. Add a database called mod4.
4. Create a new user, itp225 with the password itp225 for the host localhost.
5. Import the sql database from the file includes/mod4users.sql.
6. Browse http://localhost/cbennington225mod5/.
7. Use the nav menu at the top to navigate to each page that utilizes a portion of php functionality.
8. I added the search function to the second to last page.
9. I also included a page to find a local paintball field nearest to each member using Google Maps.
10. In order to make this extra part work really well, register one or more real addresses. It is hard for a map to show the nearest field to a nonexistent location. Google Maps focuses on the ZIP.
